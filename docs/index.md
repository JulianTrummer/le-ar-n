# Welcome

Welcome to **L.E.A.R.N.**, a platform dedicated to beginner-friendly creative coding tutorials and exercises for building architecture with robots. 

In these tutorials, we will introduce computational methods for architecture, fabrication & construction, incentivising computational literacy. Students will learn the theoretical background and basic implementation details of fundamental datastructures and algorithms, and to plan and control robot tasks in CAD environments using the COMPAS and COMPAS_fab framework, and other open-source libraries.

We want to provide access to our tutorials for as many students as possible. If you are affiliated with TUM or Princeton, you can register for the class. If you are a student from another university or simply interested in Digital Fabrication using robots, you can simply access the tutorial videos through this webpage.
